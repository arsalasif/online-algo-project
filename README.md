# Experimental Analysis of Sequential Search Heuristics
Online Algo Project

This project is done on Java and Python. All code is documented by comments inside code.

For Java, please download Eclipse:
https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/release/neon/2/eclipse-ide-java-developers
Java SE 9 or above is needed: https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html

Java Common Math library is already included in project. Reference: http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-math/

For Python, please download Anaconda:
https://www.anaconda.com/download/

The repository contains Java project at its root. It is enclosed in "eclipse-workspace" folder.

Python code is contained in "python-workspace" and it is enclosed in the Java project. This was done so Java project could more easily write files in its children directories.

Instructions:
1. Install Python and Java as noted before.
2. If you want to see output of the figures or data as shown in paper, please start iPython notebook and see the output. It currently contains all CSV files with data from paper.
3. If you want to reproduce output, run the Java project and it will create new CSV files. Note that it is not exactly the same on each run due to random nature of probabilties. However, it follows similar trends.
4. After running the Java project, run the iPython notebook to see output of newly generated CSV files.


For any clarification, please email me. Email given in project report.
